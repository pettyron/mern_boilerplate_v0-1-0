# MERN (MongoDB Express React NodeJS) Stack Boilerplate

This framework boilerplate requires NodeJS greater than 7.6.x.

A complete list of available package dependencies via NPM is located in the package_dependencies.md file.

_TODO_: Put in the testing framework. Not sure if this will be Jasmine or Mocha at the moment (with Karma).
